# Digit-Recognition-MNSIT-
Small project for testing the efficiency of a few different ML-Algorithms.
In DR_main the different training functions can be called and trained on the NMIST data set. 

So far are the supported models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector machine
  - Fully Connected Neural Network
  - Convolutional Neural Network

The tree, forest and SVM models are based on the scipy module, while the neural networks are based on pytorch.


TODO:
  - Add Visualisation for the performances
  - requirement.txt
  - improve readability
